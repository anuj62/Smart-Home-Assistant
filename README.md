# smarthome


Smarthome is an android-based smarthome assistant designed to request and retrieve information through speech.
Currently, the application fetches data from flowthings.io and uses IBM Watson relationship extraction to process vocal input.
The expected input format is "what is the 'measurement parameter' in 'location'".
The application can take multiple input locations/measurement parameters at once.
Eg. "what is the temperature in the auditorium and room 101"
